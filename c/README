# Inline

The meaning of the _inline_ qualifier is defined in C99.

There is different meaning in Gcc C89.

This library requires C99 behaviour.

Inline functions are declared in .h files, and the corresponding .c file mentions the definition (as _extern inline_).

This library compiles cleanly with Gcc-11.2 and Clang-13.0.
